A Deep Dive in Computer Architecture: My implementation of the Nand2Tetris project.
# Building a Computer from First Principles (Nand2Tetris)

This repository contains my progress and implementation of the **Nand2Tetris** project (The Elements of Computing Systems). The goal is to build a fully functional computer system, starting from a single NAND gate and scaling up to a high-level object-oriented language and a game.

## 🎯 The Goal
The project bridges the gap between hardware and software. By the end, I will have built:
- A 16-bit Hardware Architecture (**Hack**)
- An **Assembler** for the custom instruction set
- A **Virtual Machine** (Stack-based)
- A **Compiler** for a Java-like language (**Jack**)
- A basic **Operating System**

## 🚀 Progress Tracker
- [x] **Project 1-5: Hardware** (Logic Gates, ALU, CPU, Memory)
- [x] **Project 6: Assembler** (Translating Mnemonics to Binary)
- [ ] **Project 7-8: Virtual Machine** (Stack-based architecture)
- [ ] **Project 10-11: Compiler** (Tokenizing & Code Generation)
- [ ] **Project 12: OS & Application** (Standard Libraries & Tetris)

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **HDL:** Hardware Description Language for logic simulation.
- **Languages:** Still unsure, will decide between Java or C++.
- **Simulators:** Hardware Simulator, CPU Emulator, and VM Emulator provided by the course.

## 🧠 Why I'm doing this
I believe that to be a great software engineer, one must understand the "magic" happening under the hood. This journey is about mastering abstraction layers and understanding how high-level code eventually becomes electrical signals in a CPU.
